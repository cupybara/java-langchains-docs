The [following unit test](https://github.com/cupybara/java-langchains/tree/master/src/test/java/io/github/cupybara/javalangchains/usecases/DocumentComparisonTest.java) shows how the existing chains may be used to compare 2 or more documents.
I guess more abstraction would be useful. I will target that in one of the next releases and then also include example code in this README.

The following diagram shows how the implementation for this usecase works:
